  bio: `I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Stanford University, 
where I lead the Intelligent Systems Laboratory. My research spans the intersection of machine learning, 
natural language processing, and human-computer interaction, with a focus on developing AI systems that 
are both powerful and interpretable. I received my Ph.D. from Stanford in 2020, and previously held 
positions at MIT CSAIL and Google Brain. My work has been recognized with an NSF CAREER Award, 
a Sloan Research Fellowship, and multiple best paper awards at top-tier venues.`,
