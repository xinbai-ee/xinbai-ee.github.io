  bio: `I am a hardware/software co-designer with a strong passion for UAVs and robotics, bringing extensive field experience into every stage of system development. Rather than defining myself by a list of skills, I focus on how I integrate hands-on deployment experience, system-level thinking, and cross-disciplinary engineering knowledge to solve real-world problems and create tangible value.\n
My approach centers on understanding complex electromechanical and embedded systems holistically—not only in controlled lab settings, but in real operational environments. I combine hardware design, software development, sensor integration, and control optimization with on-site testing, troubleshooting, and iterative refinement to deliver practical, reliable, and field-ready solutions.\n
Through repeated and strongly field deployments experience, system bring-up, and real-world validation, I have developed a strong ability to diagnose issues under pressure, adapt to environmental constraints, and translate operational feedback into technical improvements. I am driven by results, grounded in engineering rigor, and committed to turning ideas into measurable technical impact through hands-on execution.`,
