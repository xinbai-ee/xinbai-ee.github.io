    description: `
      In 2019, I formally began my undergraduate studies in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Utah.

During this period, I built a solid foundation in core engineering disciplines, including mechanics, materials science, mechanical design, and manufacturing processes. Through extensive laboratory work and project-based learning, I developed strong skills in engineering modeling, problem decomposition, and experimental validation.

As my studies progressed, I came to recognize that complex engineering systems rely not only on mechanical structures, but also on control, computation, and intelligent decision-making. This realization naturally led me to expand my interests toward computation, algorithms, and intelligent systems, laying the groundwork for my later interdisciplinary focus on electrical and computer engineering, robotics, and autonomous systems.
